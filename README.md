## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<wayneOhito234>/FinalProject.git
cd FinalProject
```
2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows â†’ venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install dependecies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (Optional if you add dependencies later)
```
4. Initialize the database
```bash
python -c "from database import init_db; init_db()"
```
5. Run the application
```bash
python cli.py
```
## Technologies Used
Python 3
SQLite3 for lightweight data storage
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design pattern

## Developer Notes
All database interactions are handled through database.py for consistency.
init_db() automatically creates all necessary tables if they donâ€™t exist.
CLI is designed for easy expansion â€” you can add new models or menus seamlessly.
